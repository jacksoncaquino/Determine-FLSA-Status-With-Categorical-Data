## How does the FLSA classify overtime pay?
Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay. They are paid salary, not hourly. Their salary has to be greater than $35k/year. These are usually Executives/management, administrators, higher level professionals. They are not required to log their work hours.
Non-Exempt employees, on the other hand, are eligible for overtime pay. They are required to log their work hours, paid overtime for any hour worked above 40 hours a week.
